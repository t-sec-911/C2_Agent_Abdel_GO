# Server Configuration
PORT=8080

# Server Bind Address - IMPORTANT for network access
# ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
# 
# Option 1: 0.0.0.0 (Network Accessible) - DEFAULT
#   • Accepts connections from ANY network interface (LAN, WiFi, VMs, etc.)
#   • Use this when agents are on different machines (e.g., Windows VM → Your Computer)
#   • ⚠️  WARNING: Anyone on your network can connect to the C2 server!
#   • Example: Windows VM agent can connect via http://192.168.1.100:8080
#
# Option 2: 127.0.0.1 (Localhost Only)
#   • Accepts connections from localhost ONLY (same machine)
#   • Use this for testing with agent on the same computer
#   • More secure, but agents on other machines CANNOT connect
#   • Example: Only works with http://127.0.0.1:8080 or http://localhost:8080
#
# Default: 0.0.0.0 (for Windows VM testing and network deployment)
# For localhost-only security: Set to 127.0.0.1
